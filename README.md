Here we have a product feature that allow users to easily oversee all agents within the company. This is the first iteration into giving our staff memebers the ability to transfer agents directly to outside agents with just a click of a button. As you can see we are having some errors right off the bat. Please do your best to resolve these errors to allow all users to see the full list of agents.

Please reference the image attatched below and use this to get a better understanding of what we're looking for in terms of first iteration. Also note this code will fall into the hands of many other engineers so please make it easy to read and follow.

In terms of adding functionality not shown within the screenshot such as adding UI design, please feel free to add what you would like in the allotted time, but do not make it your primary focus. Clean functional code is our main focus here at eXp. Also please feel free to change any variables names to make it easier for other engineers to read your code. PLEASE also add comments along any code you changed along the way.
